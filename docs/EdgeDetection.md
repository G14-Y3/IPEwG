# Edge Detection

Edge Detection is implemented using a Canny edge detection algorithm.  It is a multi-stage algorithmdeveloped by John F. Canny in 1986. Our implementation uses a variation of the original version,which consists of five steps:  grayscale, noise reduction using Gaussian filter, gradient calculation, non-maximum  suppression,  threshold  and  edge  tracking.   It  first  turns  the  image  into  a  grayscale  version,using the grayscale implementation specified in Section 3.1.2.  Next, the image will be blurred using a Gaussian filter with a radius of 4 to perform noise reduction.  Subsequently, the algorithm uses the Sobel filters shown in Equation 3 to calculate the gradient of the image by convolving the Sobel filters withimage pixels.  This is to highlight the edges.  The reason of using the Sobel filters relies on the definition of edges in images:  edges correspond to a change of pixelsâ€™ intensity.  To detect it, the easiest way is toapply filters that highlight this intensity change in both directions:  horizontal (x) and vertical (y).  Thenext  step  is  to  perform  non-maximum  suppression,  which  produces  thin  edges  by  keeping  pixels  withhigher intensity in the same direction of the gradient.  Finally, threshold and edge tracking is performedby marking strong and weak pixels, and keeping pixels that are relevant to the edges to produce the final result.
