# Salt & Pepper Noise

Salt  &  pepper  noise  is  implemented  using  a  random  number  generator  to  randomly  add  black  or white pixels on the image. User can provide a noise ratio to indicate how frequent the black or white pixel should appear.  The noise ratio acts as a threshold to the values generated by the random number generator: the algorithm traverses every pixel in the image and generates a random number every time.  Ifthe generated number is above the noise ratio, we do nothing; otherwise we compare this random numberwithnoiseratio2:  if it is below half of the noise ratio, we replace the pixel with a black colour; otherwise we replace the pixel with a white colour.

See the project report for more details.
