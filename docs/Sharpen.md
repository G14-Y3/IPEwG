# Sharpen

Sharpen is implemented by convolving the image with a sharpen kernel.  Among other kernel used inimage convolution, the sharpen kernel particularly emphasizes differences in adjacent pixel values, whichmakes the image look more vivid.  Similar to the Sobel filter used in the edge detection, we use a sharpen kernel kernel to achieve the goal of increasing the difference between the current pixeland its adjacent pixels.  There are other possible variants of sharpen kernel as well. They all produce sharpened images, with differences in visual acutance.

See reports for more detailed explanation of the sharpen kernel.
